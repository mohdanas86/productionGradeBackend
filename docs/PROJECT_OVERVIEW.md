# Project Overview - Simple Explanation

---

## Project Name
**Production Grade Backend API**

---

## What is This Project?

This is a backend server application (like the engine of a car) that handles:
- User accounts (signup, login, logout)
- File uploads (profile pictures, cover images)
- Secure authentication (keeping user data safe)
- Database operations (saving and retrieving data)

---

## Why Was This Built?

- To create a professional-grade backend that can be used for real applications
- To follow industry best practices
- To make it easy for developers to build on top of it
- To learn and demonstrate modern backend development skills

---

## Main Features (What It Can Do)

### 1. User Management
- Users can create accounts (register)
- Users can login with email and password
- Users can logout securely
- Passwords are encrypted (nobody can see the actual password)
- Profile pictures and cover images can be uploaded

### 2. Security
- Uses JWT tokens (like digital keys) to verify users
- Two types of tokens: access token (short-lived) and refresh token (long-lived)
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (impossible to reverse)
- Protected routes (some pages only logged-in users can access)

### 3. File Uploads
- Users can upload images
- Files are stored on Cloudinary (cloud storage)
- Temporary files are automatically cleaned up
- Supports avatar and cover image uploads

### 4. Error Handling
- If something goes wrong, users get clear error messages
- Errors are caught and handled properly
- No server crashes on errors

### 5. Code Quality
- Code is automatically formatted (looks clean and consistent)
- Uses modern JavaScript features
- Well-organized folder structure
- Easy to read and maintain

## Technologies Used (Tools & Libraries)

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Node.js** | JavaScript runtime (makes JavaScript work on server) |
| **Express.js** | Web framework (handles requests and responses) |
| **MongoDB** | Database (stores user data, videos, etc.) |
| **Mongoose** | Database tool (makes MongoDB easier to use) |
| **JWT** | Authentication tokens (secure login system) |
| **Bcrypt** | Password encryption (hashes passwords) |
| **Multer** | File upload handler (receives files from users) |
| **Cloudinary** | Cloud storage (stores images online) |
| **Prettier** | Code formatter (makes code look neat) |
| **dotenv** | Environment variables (keeps secrets safe) |

---

## How It Works (Simple Flow)

### 1. User Registration
```
User fills form → Server receives data → Validates data →
Uploads images to cloud → Hashes password → Saves to database →
Returns success message
```

### 2. User Login
```
User enters email/password → Server checks database →
Verifies password → Creates JWT tokens →
Sends tokens in cookies → User is logged in
```

### 3. Accessing Protected Routes
```
User makes request → Server checks token →
Verifies token is valid → Allows access OR denies access
```

### 4. File Upload
```
User selects file → Multer saves temporarily →
Cloudinary uploads to cloud → Returns URL →
URL saved in database → Temporary file deleted
```

## Folder Structure Explained

```
src/
├── controllers/    → Functions that handle requests (business logic)
├── models/        → Database schemas (defines data structure)
├── routes/        → URL paths (defines which URL does what)
├── middlewares/   → Functions that run before main logic (security checks)
├── utils/         → Helper functions (reusable code)
├── db/            → Database connection setup
├── app.js         → Express app configuration
└── index.js       → Starting point of application

public/temp/       → Temporary storage for uploaded files
.env              → Secret keys and configuration (NOT in Git)
package.json      → Project information and dependencies
```

## Key Concepts for Beginners

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A way for frontend (website) to talk to backend (server)

### REST API
A standard way of designing APIs using HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)

### Middleware
Functions that run between receiving a request and sending a response

### JWT (JSON Web Token)
A secure way to verify user identity without storing sessions

### Hashing
One-way encryption (can't be reversed, keeps passwords safe)

### Environment Variables
Secret information stored outside code (passwords, API keys)

### Schema
Blueprint of how data should look in database

### MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller)
A way to organize code:
- **Model**: Database structure
- **View**: What user sees (JSON responses in APIs)
- **Controller**: Logic that connects them

```bash
npm start              # Start the server
npm run format         # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check   # Check if code is formatted
git add .              # Stage changes for commit
git commit -m "msg"    # Save changes with message

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Server won't start** | Check if `.env` file exists and has all required variables |
| **Database connection failed** | Check MongoDB URL and internet connection |
| **File upload not working** | Verify Cloudinary credentials in `.env` |
| **JWT token invalid** | Check `JWT_SECRET` in `.env` matches |
| **CI/CD failing** | Run `npm run format` before pushing code |
